Process/thread creation and inter-process communication

Goals: 
- Process creation in Linux using fork() and exec() system calls. 
- Thread creation in Linux with the pthread API
- Inter-process communnication using pipes

## Assignment Two
Semaphores/inter-thread synchronization

Goal:
- Practice semaphore and monitor usage

## Assignment Three
Page Replacement Algorithms (LRU, CLOCK, FIFO)

Goal: 
- To use a simulation for evaluating various page replacement algorithms studied in class
